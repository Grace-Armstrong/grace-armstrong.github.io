        <h2>Why Blackjack?</h2>
        <p>After college I started getting into blackjack and was interested in the edge that players who master basic strategy and card counting can gain.</p>
        <h3>Why make your own trainer?</h2>
        <p>There are many blackjack trainers out there, but I wanted to make my own to learn more about programming and to have a tool that I could customize to my own needs as I learn. The development would also be helpful in my learning process.</p>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>The Blackjack Trainer is a simple web application that allows users to practice their blackjack skills. It provides a user-friendly interface where players can simulate games, learn basic strategy, and track their progress.</p>   
        <h4>I want to learn BlackJack!</h4>
